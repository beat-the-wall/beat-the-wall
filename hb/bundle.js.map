The callback would return CSS like\n *\n *   '.foo:nth-child(2n):hover{color:red !important;}'\n *\n * and the handler would then return that resulting CSS.\n *\n * `defaultSelectorHandlers` is the list of default handlers used in a call to\n * `generateCSS`.\n *\n * @name SelectorHandler\n * @function\n * @param {string} selector: The currently inspected selector. ':hover' in the\n *     example above.\n * @param {string} baseSelector: The selector of the parent styles.\n *     '.foo:nth-child(2n)' in the example above.\n * @param {function} generateSubtreeStyles: A function which can be called to\n *     generate CSS for the subtree of styles corresponding to the selector.\n *     Accepts a new baseSelector to use for generating those styles.\n * @returns {?string} The generated CSS for this selector, or null if we don't\n *     handle this selector.\n */\nvar defaultSelectorHandlers = [\n// Handle pseudo-selectors, like :hover and :nth-child(3n)\nfunction pseudoSelectors(selector, /* : string */\nbaseSelector, /* : string */\ngenerateSubtreeStyles /* : Function */\n) /* */{\n    if (selector[0] !== \":\") {\n        return null;\n    }\n    return generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector + selector);\n},\n\n// Handle media queries (or font-faces)\nfunction mediaQueries(selector, /* : string */\nbaseSelector, /* : string */\ngenerateSubtreeStyles /* : Function */\n) /* */{\n    if (selector[0] !== \"@\") {\n        return null;\n    }\n    // Generate the styles normally, and then wrap them in the media query.\n    var generated = generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector);\n    return selector + '{' + generated + '}';\n}];\n\nexports.defaultSelectorHandlers = defaultSelectorHandlers;\n/**\n * Generate CSS for a selector and some styles.\n *\n * This function handles the media queries and pseudo selectors that can be used\n * in aphrodite styles.\n *\n * @param {string} selector: A base CSS selector for the styles to be generated\n *     with.\n * @param {Object} styleTypes: A list of properties of the return type of\n *     StyleSheet.create, e.g. [styles.red, styles.blue].\n * @param {Array.<SelectorHandler>} selectorHandlers: A list of selector\n *     handlers to use for handling special selectors.

It can be a\n//                      function or an array of strings.\n//          space       an optional parameter that specifies the indentation\n//                      of nested structures. If it is omitted, the text will\n//                      be packed without extra whitespace. If it is a number,\n//                      it will specify the number of spaces to indent at each\n//                      level. If it is a string (such as \"\\t\" or \"&nbsp;\"),\n//                      it contains the characters used to indent at each level.\n//          This method produces a JSON text from a JavaScript value.\n//          When an object value is found, if the object contains a toJSON\n//          method, its toJSON method will be called and the result will be\n//          stringified. A toJSON method does not serialize: it returns the\n//          value represented by the name/value pair that should be serialized,\n//          or undefined if nothing should be serialized. The toJSON method\n//          will be passed the key associated with the value, and this will be\n//          bound to the value.\n\n//          For example, this would serialize Dates as ISO strings.\n\n//              Date.prototype.toJSON = function (key) {\n//                  function f(n) {\n//                      // Format integers to have at least two digits.\n//                      return (n < 10)\n//                          ? \"0\" + n\n//                          : n;\n//                  }\n//                  return this.getUTCFullYear()   + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMonth() + 1) + \"-\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCDate())      + \"T\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCHours())     + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCMinutes())   + \":\" +\n//                       f(this.getUTCSeconds())   + \"Z\";\n//              };\n\n//          You can provide an optional replacer method. It will be passed the\n//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\n//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n//          used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n//          such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n//          stringified.\n\n//          Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n//          functions, will not be serialized. Such values in objects will be\n//          dropped; in arrays they will be replaced with null. You can use\n//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\n//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n//          easier to read.\n\n//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n//          be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n//          the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}]);\n//          // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}], null, \"\\t\");\n//          // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n//              return this[key] instanceof Date\n//                  ? \"Date(\" + this[key] + \")\"\n//                  : value;\n//          });\n//          // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n//      JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n//          This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n//          It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n//          The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n//          transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n//          and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n//          If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n//          If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          // Parse the text. Values that look like ISO date strings will\n//          // be converted to Date objects.\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse(text, function (key, value) {\n//              var a;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\") {\n//                  a =\n//   /^(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})T(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}):(\\d{2}(?:\\.\\d*)?)Z$/.exec(value);\n//                  if (a) {\n//                      return new Date(Date.UTC(+a[1], +a[2] - 1, +a[3], +a[4],\n//                          +a[5], +a[6]));\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//          myData = JSON.parse('[\"Date(09/09/2001)\"]', function (key, value) {\n//              var d;\n//              if (typeof value === \"string\" &&\n//                      value.slice(0, 5) === \"Date(\" &&\n//                      value.slice(-1) === \")\") {\n//                  d = new Date(value.slice(5, -1));\n//                  if (d) {\n//                      return d;\n//                  }\n//              }\n//              return value;\n//          });\n\n//  This is a reference implementation.

differently than normal style definitions. These functions look at the\n * current selector and can generate CSS for the styles in their subtree by\n * calling the callback with a new selector.\n *\n * For example, when generating styles with a base selector of '.foo' and the\n * following styles object:\n *\n *   {\n *     ':nth-child(2n)': {\n *       ':hover': {\n *         color: 'red'\n *       }\n *     }\n *   }\n *\n * when we reach the ':hover' style, we would call our selector handlers like\n *\n *   handler(':hover', '.foo:nth-child(2n)', callback)\n *\n * Since our `pseudoSelectors` handles ':hover' styles, that handler would call\n * the callback like\n *\n *   callback('.foo:nth-child(2n):hover')\n *\n * to generate its subtree `{ color: 'red' }` styles with a\n * '.foo:nth-child(2n):hover' selector. The callback would return CSS like\n *\n *   '.foo:nth-child(2n):hover{color:red !important;}'\n *\n * and the handler would then return that resulting CSS.\n *\n * `defaultSelectorHandlers` is the list of default handlers used in a call to\n * `generateCSS`.\n *\n * @name SelectorHandler\n * @function\n * @param {string} selector: The currently inspected selector. ':hover' in the\n *     example above.\n * @param {string} baseSelector: The selector of the parent styles.\n *     '.foo:nth-child(2n)' in the example above.\n * @param {function} generateSubtreeStyles: A function which can be called to\n *     generate CSS for the subtree of styles corresponding to the selector.\n *     Accepts a new baseSelector to use for generating those styles.\n * @returns {?string} The generated CSS for this selector, or null if we don't\n *     handle this selector.\n */\nvar defaultSelectorHandlers = [\n// Handle pseudo-selectors, like :hover and :nth-child(3n)\nfunction pseudoSelectors(selector, /* : string */\nbaseSelector, /* : string */\ngenerateSubtreeStyles /* : Function */\n) /* */{\n    if (selector[0] !== \":\") {\n        return null;\n    }\n    return generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector + selector);\n},\n\n// Handle media queries (or font-faces)\nfunction mediaQueries(selector, /* : string */\nbaseSelector, /* : string */\ngenerateSubtreeStyles /* : Function */\n) /* */{\n    if (selector[0] !== \"@\") {\n        return null;\n    }\n    // Generate the styles normally, and then wrap them in the media query.\n    var generated = generateSubtreeStyles(baseSelector);\n    return selector + '{' + generated + '}';\n}];\n\nexports.defaultSelectorHandlers = defaultSelectorHandlers;\n/**\n * Generate CSS for a selector and some styles.\n *\n * This function handles the media queries and pseudo selectors that can be used\n * in aphrodite styles.\n *\n * @param {string} selector: A base CSS selector for the styles to be generated\n *     with.\n * @param {Object} styleTypes: A list of properties of the return type of\n *     StyleSheet.create, e.g. [styles.red, styles.blue].\n * @param {Array.<SelectorHandler>} selectorHandlers: A list of selector\n *     handlers to use for handling special selectors.

It will be passed the\n//          key and value of each member, with this bound to the containing\n//          object. The value that is returned from your method will be\n//          serialized. If your method returns undefined, then the member will\n//          be excluded from the serialization.\n\n//          If the replacer parameter is an array of strings, then it will be\n//          used to select the members to be serialized. It filters the results\n//          such that only members with keys listed in the replacer array are\n//          stringified.\n\n//          Values that do not have JSON representations, such as undefined or\n//          functions, will not be serialized.

You can use\n//          a replacer function to replace those with JSON values.\n\n//          JSON.stringify(undefined) returns undefined.\n\n//          The optional space parameter produces a stringification of the\n//          value that is filled with line breaks and indentation to make it\n//          easier to read.\n\n//          If the space parameter is a non-empty string, then that string will\n//          be used for indentation. If the space parameter is a number, then\n//          the indentation will be that many spaces.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}]);\n//          // text is '[\"e\",{\"pluribus\":\"unum\"}]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([\"e\", {pluribus: \"unum\"}], null, \"\\t\");\n//          // text is '[\\n\\t\"e\",\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\t\"pluribus\": \"unum\"\\n\\t}\\n]'\n\n//          text = JSON.stringify([new Date()], function (key, value) {\n//              return this[key] instanceof Date\n//                  ? \"Date(\" + this[key] + \")\"\n//                  : value;\n//          });\n//          // text is '[\"Date(---current time---)\"]'\n\n//      JSON.parse(text, reviver)\n//          This method parses a JSON text to produce an object or array.\n//          It can throw a SyntaxError exception.\n\n//          The optional reviver parameter is a function that can filter and\n//          transform the results. It receives each of the keys and values,\n//          and its return value is used instead of the original value.\n//          If it returns what it received, then the structure is not modified.\n//          If it returns undefined then the member is deleted.\n\n//          Example:\n\n//          // Parse the text.
